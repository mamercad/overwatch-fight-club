# Overwatch Fight Club

> So, after watching the POTG, that player can say the words, "by the rules of Overwatch Fight Club, I, `<gamertag>`, decree that the next match be played by the rules of **ALL ULTS**".

The first rule of Overwatch Fight Club (OFC) is ~~"you do not talk about Fight Club"~~ is "the player that got the Play of the Game can call the meta-game to be played in the upcoming match". OFC came about organically on the evening of January 4th, 2025. Mark, Mike, and Phil were playing the time-limited reboot of "6v6" and, on a lark, Mark and Phil decided to do **double dive tanks** with the following caveats (highest-to-lowest precedence):

* Must always run two (2) dive tanks.
* Must always prioritize winning:
  * This means that sometimes, dive must halt in order to win a critical fight, stay on the payload during overtime, etc.
* Must always priorities going after "squishies" (supports and dps).
* Of course, common sense prevails, for example if on your way to back-lining squishies, you encounter a really low tank, of course you clean them up first - then, continue the meta-game.

The hope is that OFC, in the spirit of _the_ Fight Club, spreads organically, i.e., there is nothing stopping _you_ from calling this out for the folks which happen to be in voice comms and watching the POTG (maybe it would give you better luck with `play as team`). In any event, we think that OFC gives a game that the three of us have been playing for a long, long time, a bit of fun and new-ness. It was _really_ fun doing Winston+D.va all round long (no, Mike, I **absoluely** did not forget saying "go Mercy" - that Mercy kite is `<3`).

## Example Meta Games

> Consider variations such as inverses and substitions of the following examples as well (and please, PR them back)

* _NO REPEATS_ - Every time you die, you must choose a different hero on respawn.
* _BACK-LINE REIN_ - You play Reinhardt for the entire round and, using the same _reasonable_ priorities as above, prioritize back-lining the enemy as must as _reasonable_.
* _NO ULTS_ - As it sounds, you are not allowed to use your ultimate.
* _ALL ULTS_ - Every member of the Fight Club, must, without reservation, combo every ult at the _same time_; what you are thinking is right, _yes_, every single member in the Fight Club must also then _have_ their ultimate to begin with!
* _SHIELDS ONLY_ - Every member of the Fight Club must use a hero that has a shield, for example: Rein, Sigma, Brig, etc.
* _ALL DIVE_ - All dive heros!
* _SANTA_ - All heros that place objects on the map: Sym's and Torb for their turrets, Hog and Junk for their traps, etc.
* _RACE TO SPAWN_ Your priority is touching the enemy spawn door ("race") before the other OFC members. For a twist consider adding on "no pew-pew", i.e., absolutely no shooting (melee is fine) until you have touched the enemy spawn door (also, at this time, you say "SPAWN RACE WINNER" in voice comms).
